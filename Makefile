# Simply expanded variables are defined by lines using `:=' (see section Setting
# Variables). The value of a simply expanded variable is scanned once and for
# all, expanding any references to other variables and functions, when the
# variable is defined. The actual value of the simply expanded variable is the
# result of expanding the text that you write. It does not contain any
# references to other variables; it contains their values as of the time this
# variable was defined.
